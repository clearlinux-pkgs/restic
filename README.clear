Create vendored dependencies for offline build by updating the
projects/restic-vendor repository. In restic-vendor, run `make VER="<ResticVer>"` to
automate most of the process, where <ResticVer> is the upstream restic version
(without the "v" prefix).

If a hotfix restic-vendor release is ever needed, extend the release version with
a 4th number. For example, a hotfix release for restic-vendor 0.12.0 would have
version "0.12.0.1", a second hotfix release would be "0.12.0.2", etc.
